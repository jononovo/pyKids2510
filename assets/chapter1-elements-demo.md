## TREASURE ARCHIPELAGO

Welcome to the Treasure Archipelago! A vast collection of islands full of secrets, collectibles, and adventure. This chapter demonstrates map inheritance between missions across multiple unique islands.

--- <!-- Mission 1 -->
## MISSION 1: ISLAND EXPLORER

### AVAILABLE AFTER
Starting the game

### OBJECTIVE
> Explore Starter Island and collect 5 gold coins scattered around the beach and forest paths

You've just arrived at the Archipelago! Use `move_forward()`, `turn_left()`, and `turn_right()` to navigate the paths. Collect coins with `collect()` and return to base camp.

### SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Collect all 5 gold coins
- Return to your starting position (base camp)
- Use the collect() command

### REWARDS
- Coins: +5
- Unlocks Mission 2

<!-- Starter Code -->
```
import player

# Explore the island and collect coins!
# Use move_forward() and turn commands
player.move_forward()
```

<!-- Solution -->
```
import player

# Walk north to first coin
player.move_forward(5)
player.collect()  # Coin 1 at (27,46)

# Continue north to second coin
player.move_forward(2)
player.collect()  # Coin 2 at (27,44)

# Go left to third coin
player.turn_left()
player.move_forward(2)
player.collect()  # Coin 3 at (25,44)

# Go right to fourth coin
player.turn_right()
player.turn_right()
player.move_forward(4)
player.collect()  # Coin 4 at (29,44)

# Go north to fifth coin
player.turn_left()
player.move_forward(2)
player.collect()  # Coin 5 at (29,42)

# Return to base camp (currently at 29,42 facing north)
player.turn_right()
player.turn_right()  # now facing south
player.move_forward(9)  # to (29,51)
player.turn_right()  # facing west
player.move_forward(2)  # to (27,51)
```

## MISSION 2: KEY COLLECTION

### AVAILABLE AFTER
Completing Mission 1

### OBJECTIVE
> Learn Python dictionary syntax by collecting keys with `inventory["key"] += 1`

In this mission, you'll learn to track items using Python's dictionary syntax. The `inventory` is a Python dictionary that stores item counts. Instead of using `collect()`, you'll add items directly using:

```python
inventory["key"] += 1
```

Navigate to each key and use this syntax to add it to your inventory. This is how real Python programmers track quantities!

### SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Find both keys on the island
- Use `inventory["key"] += 1` to collect each one
- Return to base camp facing north

### REWARDS
- Keys: +2
- Unlocks Mission 3

<!-- Starter Code -->
```
import player

# Navigate to the keys and collect them using:
# inventory["key"] += 1
player.move_forward()
```

<!-- Solution -->
```
import player

# Navigate to the first key at (24,46)
player.move_forward(5)
player.turn_left()
player.move_forward(3)

# Add the first key using dictionary syntax
inventory["key"] += 1

# Move to the second key at (26,46)
player.turn_left()
player.turn_left()  # facing east
player.move_forward(2)

# Add the second key using dictionary syntax
inventory["key"] += 1

# Return to base camp facing north
player.move_forward(1)  # to (27,46)
player.turn_right()  # facing south
player.move_forward(5)  # to (27,51)
player.turn_left()
player.turn_left()  # facing north
```

<!-- Map -->
```
startPos: 27,51
goalPos: 27,51
collectibles: [["key", [[24,46], [26,46]]]]
```
