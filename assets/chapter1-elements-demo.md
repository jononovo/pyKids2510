## TREASURE ARCHIPELAGO

Welcome to the Treasure Archipelago! A vast collection of islands full of secrets, collectibles, and adventure. This chapter demonstrates map inheritance between missions across multiple unique islands.

--- <!-- Mission 1 -->
## MISSION 1: ISLAND EXPLORER

### AVAILABLE AFTER
Starting the game

### OBJECTIVE
> Explore Starter Island and collect 5 gold coins scattered around the beach and forest paths

You've just arrived at the Archipelago! Use `move_forward()`, `turn_left()`, and `turn_right()` to navigate the paths. Collect coins with `collect()` and return to base camp.

### SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Collect all 5 gold coins
- Return to your starting position (base camp)
- Use the collect() command

### REWARDS
- Coins: +5
- Unlocks Mission 2

<!-- Starter Code -->
```
import player

# Explore the island and collect coins!
# Use move_forward() and turn commands
player.move_forward()
```

<!-- Solution -->
```
import player

# Walk north to first coin
player.move_forward(5)
player.collect()  # Coin 1 at (27,46)

# Continue north to second coin
player.move_forward(2)
player.collect()  # Coin 2 at (27,44)

# Go left to third coin
player.turn_left()
player.move_forward(2)
player.collect()  # Coin 3 at (25,44)

# Go right to fourth coin
player.turn_right()
player.turn_right()
player.move_forward(4)
player.collect()  # Coin 4 at (29,44)

# Go north to fifth coin
player.turn_left()
player.move_forward(2)
player.collect()  # Coin 5 at (29,42)

# Return to base camp (currently at 29,42 facing north)
player.turn_right()
player.turn_right()  # now facing south
player.move_forward(9)  # to (29,51)
player.turn_right()  # facing west
player.move_forward(2)  # to (27,51)
```

## MISSION 2: FARMING TEST

### AVAILABLE AFTER
Completing Mission 1

### OBJECTIVE
> Test the farming mechanism - plant crops, water them, and harvest!

Welcome to the farm! In this mission you'll learn to grow your own food using Python. The farming commands are:

- `plant("corn")` - Plants a crop at your current position
- `water()` - Waters a sprout to help it grow
- `harvest()` - Harvests a fully grown crop

After planting, wait for the sprout to appear (30 seconds), then water it. After watering, wait for the crop to grow (30 seconds), then harvest!

### SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Plant at least one crop
- Use the farming commands: plant(), water(), harvest()

### REWARDS
- Corn: +1
- Farming knowledge!

<!-- Starter Code -->
```
import player

# Welcome to the farm!
# Try the farming commands:
# plant("corn") - plant a crop
# water() - water a sprout  
# harvest() - harvest grown crops

# Walk to a good spot and plant!
player.move_forward(2)
plant("corn")

# Now wait 30 seconds for sprout...
# Then run: water()
# Wait 30 more seconds...
# Then run: harvest()
```

<!-- Solution -->
```
import player

# Walk to the farming area
player.move_forward(2)

# Plant some corn
plant("corn")

# NOTE: In real gameplay, you'd wait 30 seconds
# then run water(), wait 30 more seconds,
# then run harvest()

# For testing, you can run this code,
# wait for the messages, then run:
# water()
# ...wait...
# harvest()
```

## MISSION 3: BUILD A HOUSE

### AVAILABLE AFTER
Completing Mission 2

### OBJECTIVE
> Collect wood and build your first house!

Now you'll learn to build! Collect 4 pieces of wood scattered near the beach, then use the `build("house")` command to construct a house. Building requires resources from your inventory.

### SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Collect 4 wood pieces
- Build a house using `build("house")`
- Return to base camp

### REWARDS
- House: +1
- Chapter Complete!

<!-- Starter Code -->
```
import player

# Collect wood and build a house!
# Use collect() to gather wood
# Use build("house") to construct
player.move_forward()
```

<!-- Solution -->
```
import player

# Collect the 4 wood pieces near base camp
# Wood 1 at (27,50) - one step north
player.move_forward()
player.collect()

# Wood 2 at (27,49) - continue north
player.move_forward()
player.collect()

# Wood 3 at (28,49) - turn right and move
player.turn_right()
player.move_forward()
player.collect()

# Wood 4 at (28,50) - move south
player.turn_right()
player.move_forward()
player.collect()

# Now we have 4 wood - build a house!
# Face the empty spot and build
player.turn_right()
player.move_forward()
player.build("house")

# Return to base camp
player.turn_left()
player.turn_left()
player.move_forward(2)
