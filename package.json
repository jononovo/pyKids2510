  "description": "This project is an interactive Python programming education platform that combines a tile-based game engine with a real-time code execution environment. The system consists of a web-based framework built with vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas that renders a 2D game world where learners control a character through Python commands. The architecture features a markdown-based lesson authoring system that defines instructional content, starter code, and tile-map layouts, which are dynamically parsed to generate progressive coding challenges. The integrated CodeJar editor provides syntax-highlighted Python editing with custom parsing logic that translates player commands (move_forward, turn_left, turn_right) into animated character movements on a 32x32 pixel tile grid.",
